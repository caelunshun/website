                        ### It's wicked fast.
                        Not "stupid fast." *Wicked fast*. Feather's architecture is built from the ground up for
                        performance and elegance.
                        Written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)—a native language as fast as C—and based on the
                        [entity-component-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system)
                        architecture, Feather can achieve performance no Vanilla fork could ever imagine.

                        ### Powerful plugins.
                        Feather plugins can achieve incredible flexibility through Feather's data-oriented API. Our
                        plugin system has been written from the start to support any functionality imaginable, to the
                        extent all gameplay features could be implemented as plugins if needed.
                    </div>
                    <div class="px-8" md>
                        ### More flexibility.
                        Thanks to Feather's modular architecture, users can configure gameplay features to meet their
                        needs. Without writing code, you can configure Feather to the exact needs of your server,
                        without sacrificing performance.

                        ### Performance
                        [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage
                        collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices, and easily
                        integrate with other languages.

                        ### Reliability
                        Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety —
                        preventing many classes of bugs at compile-time.
