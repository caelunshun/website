                    Not "stupid fast." Wicked fast. Feather's architecture is built from the ground up for performance
                    and elegance.
                    Written in Rust &mdash; a native language as fast as C &mdash; and based on the entity-component-system
                    architecture,
                    Feather can achieve performance no Vanilla fork could ever imagine.

                <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                    Feather plugins can achieve incredible flexibility through Feather's data-oriented API.
                    Our plugin system has been written from the start to support any functionality ima-ginable,
                    to the extent that all gameplay features could be implemented as plugins if needed.

                <h2 class="text-3xl">More flexability</h2>
                <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                    Thanks to Feather's modular architecture, users can configure gameplay features to meet their needs.
                    Without writing code, you can configure Feather to the exact needs of your server, with-out
                    sacrificing performance.

                    and easily integrate with other languages.
