                    Not "stupid fast." Wicked fast. Feather's architecture is built from the ground up for performance
                    and elegance.
                    Written in Rust-a native language as fast as C-and based on the entity-component-system
                    architecture,
                    Feather can achieve performance no Vanilla fork could ever imagine.

                <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                    Feather plugins can achieve incredible flexibility through Feather's data-oriented API.
                    Our plugin system has been written from the start to support any functionality imaginable,
                    to the extent that all gameplay features could be implemented as plugins if needed.

                <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
                    Thanks to Feather's modular architecture, users can configure gameplay features to meet their needs.
                    Without writing code, you can configure Feather to the exact needs of your server, without
                    sacrificing performance.

                    Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage collector,
                    it can power performance-critical services,run on embedded devices,
                    and easily integrate with other languages.

                    Rust’s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and thread-safety — preventing
                    many classes of bugs at compile-time.
