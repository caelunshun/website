                <h3>It's wicked fast</h3>
                <p>
                    Not "stupid fast." Wicked fast. Feather's architecture is built from the ground
                    up for performance and elegance. Written in Rust &mdash; a native language as
                    fast as C &mdash; and based on the entity-component-system architecture, Feather
                    can achieve performance no Vanilla fork could ever imagine.

                <h3>Powerful plugins</h3>
                <p>
                    Feather plugins can achieve incredible flexibility through Feather's
                    data-oriented API. Our plugin system has been written from the start to support
                    any functionality imaginable, to the extent that all gameplay features could be
                    implemented as plugins if needed.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>More flexibility</h3>
                <p>
                    Thanks to Feather's modular architec-ture, users can configure gameplay features
                    to meet their needs. Without writing code, you can configure Feather to the
                    exact needs of your server, with-out sacrificing performance.

                <h3>Performance</h3>
                <p>
                    Rust is blazingly fast and memory-efficient: with no runtime or garbage
                    collector, it can power performance-critical services, run on embedded devices,
                    and easily integrate with other languages.

            <div>
                <h3>Reliability</h3>
                <p>
                    Rustâ€™s rich type system and ownership model guarantee memory-safety and
                    thread-safety &mdash; preventing many classes of bugs at compile-time.

                <p>
                    Feather is run and funded by an open nonprofit association, where everyone is
                    free to join at the cost of 10 EUR. All the members are invited once a year by
                    the end of ___ to elect five to ten maintainers. These maintainers are
                    responsible for the daily maintenance of the association and the development of
                    feather. All the money raised through the association goes towards paying for
                    web and demo server; you can read more about it in the budget.
